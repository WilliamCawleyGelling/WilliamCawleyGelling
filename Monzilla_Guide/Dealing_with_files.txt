When making file names and locations it is advised that lower case is used and hyphen instead of underscore

The short answer is that you should use a hyphen for your file names. The Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator but does not regard an underscore that way. 
For these reasons, it is best to get into the habit of writing your folder and file names lowercase with no spaces and with words separated by hyphens, 
at least until you know what you're doing. That way you'll bump into fewer problems later down the road
