CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

to make style sheet with paragraphs having red writing 

p {
  color: red;
}

apply this to index.html by putting this in the <head></head> section 
<link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet">

Selector
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.

Declaration
This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

Properties
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.

Property value
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
