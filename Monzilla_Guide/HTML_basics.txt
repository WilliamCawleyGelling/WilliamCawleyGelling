HTML elements have opening tab and closing tabs <xxx> random </xxx> 
the content is the info (random) and element is all together

elements can have attributes for instance <p class="editor-note"> random </p>
The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.

An attribute should always have the following:

A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:

<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>

Empty elements
Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page:

<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

Marking up text. This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.

Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings 
<!-- 4 heading levels: -->
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>

Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <a> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:

Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".
Wrap the text in an <a> element, as shown below:
<a>Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Give the <a> element an href attribute, as shown below:
<a href="">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Copy to Clipboard
Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
Copy to Clipboard
You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.
